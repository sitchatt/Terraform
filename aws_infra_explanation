The first section provider "aws" is used to define the AWS provider, which is used to interact with the AWS API to create resources. In this example, the region variable is set to us-west-2, which specifies the region in which the resources will be created.

The second section resource "aws_vpc" "example" creates an AWS resource of type aws_vpc, which stands for Virtual Private Cloud. This resource block creates a VPC in AWS, and sets its CIDR block to 10.0.0.0/16. The tags block allows you to assign metadata to the VPC in the form of key-value pairs, where in this case the VPC is given a Name tag with the value example-vpc.

The third section resource "aws_subnet" "example" creates an AWS resource of type aws_subnet, which stands for Subnetwork. This resource block creates a subnet in the VPC, and sets its CIDR block to 10.0.1.0/24. The vpc_id variable is set to aws_vpc.example.id, which references the ID of the VPC created in the previous resource block. The tags block allows you to assign metadata to the subnet in the form of key-value pairs, where in this case the subnet is given a Name tag with the value example-subnet.

The fourth section resource "aws_security_group" "example" creates an AWS resource of type aws_security_group, which stands for Security Group. This resource block creates a security group in AWS, and allows incoming traffic on ports 22 and 80. The ingress block is used to specify the incoming traffic that is allowed, where in this case traffic from any IP address (cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]) is allowed on ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP). The tags block allows you to assign metadata to the security group in the form of key-value pairs, where in this case the security group is given a Name tag with the value example-security-group.

The fifth section resource "aws_instance" "example" creates an AWS resource of type aws_instance, which stands for EC2 Instance. This resource block creates an EC2 instance in the subnet, and specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use for the instance, which in this case is ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0. The instance_type variable is set to t2.micro, which specifies the instance type to use for the EC2 instance. The subnet_id variable is set to aws_subnet.example.id, which references the ID of the subnet created in the previous resource block. The vpc_security_group_ids variable is set to aws_security_group.example.id, which references the ID of the security group created in the previous resource block. The tags block allows you to assign metadata to the EC2 instance in the form of key-value pairs, where in this case the EC2 instance is given a Name tag with the value example-instance.
