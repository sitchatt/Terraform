Explanation :

The first section defines the AWS provider, which is used to interact with the AWS API to create resources. In this example, the region variable is set to us-west-2, which specifies the region in which to create the EC2 instance.

The second section defines an AWS resource of type aws_instance. This resource block creates an EC2 instance in AWS.

The ami variable is set to ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0, which is the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the EC2 instance. The instance_type is set to t2.micro, which specifies the instance type of the EC2 instance.

The tags block allows you to assign metadata to the EC2 instance in the form of key-value pairs. In this example, the EC2 instance is given a Name tag with the value example-instance.
